# Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap is ordered to minimize speculative framework work. Each phase now
records three things against the repository as of 2026-08:

- **Already in the repository** — do not rebuild this.
- **Gap** — what is genuinely missing.
- **Agent task** — a self-contained work item with deliverables and exit
  criteria, sized for one focused agent run.

Each task ends with evidence, regression tests
(`python -m unittest discover -s tests`), and a stated next question.
Generated maps are never evidence. The NBlood submodule is off-limits for
these tasks (it hosts the playtest bot; never stage its pointer).

# Phase 0a — Corpus integration (DONE, 2026-08-31)

**Status: complete.** The registry is in `bloodmap/patterns.py`
(`list_corpus_maps`, `resolve_corpus_map`, `unadmitted_corpus_maps`,
`build_corpus_manifest`, `observed_mode`); the CLI gained `corpus-manifest`,
`corpus-health`, and `--recursive` / `--population` / `--view` on `corpus` and
`roundtrip-all`. Manifest: `maps/blood/corpus.json`. Health:
`reports/blood-corpus-health.md` plus four per-population JSON reports.
Tests: `tests/test_corpus_registry.py`. Measured counts and the community gate
result are in `07_...md`; the campaign is **43** `E*M*.MAP` files, not 44 — the
old figure counted `DNE3L1.MAP` (a conversion) in a flat inventory.

Two findings for the owner, not fixed here:

- `maps/blood/campaign/ASAVE1.map` (an editor autosave) appeared in the
  campaign directory mid-run. It is quarantined by the name cross-check and
  reported in `corpus.json` under `unadmitted`, never mined as campaign
  convention. Move or delete it.
- `tests/test_rules.RoomOverRoomTests.test_the_two_rooms_meet_at_one_plane`
  now runs (it was hidden behind a corpus-dependent class skip) and **fails**:
  `room_over_room` treats the stack's own upper region as a plan-overlapping
  neighbour, so `lower.ceiling_z` is clamped to the upper region's ceiling
  instead of its floor (`bloodmap/roomoverroom.py:135`). Pre-existing, and
  outside Phase 0a.

## Why first

The corpus moved into subdirectories (`maps/blood/{campaign,curated,
conversions,community,tiered,mechanism}` with `multiplayer/` mode subdirs —
final layout in `07_...md`, physically done by the owner 2026-08-31) and
grew by ~1500 community maps, but `bloodmap.patterns.list_original_maps`
iterates one flat directory and classifies population purely from
filenames. Every corpus command (`corpus`, `roundtrip-all`, `pattern-mine`,
`spatial-corpus`, …) currently sees zero or partial maps. Until this is
fixed, no other phase can cite corpus evidence honestly.

Additionally, existing code and docs carry a **provenance error corrected by
the owner (2026-08-31)**: `DWE*` (Death Wish) and `TEDE*` are hand-picked
community source maps, and `DNE*` are the owner's own Duke3D→Blood
conversions — yet `classify_map_population` and the population table in
`docs/design-pattern-discovery.md` label all three prefixes `conversion`.

## Already in the repository

- fail-closed filename classifier `classify_map_population` (patterns.py) —
  needs the correction above,
- native losslessness gate and `roundtrip-all` (docs/corpus.md),
- tier metadata in `maps/blood/tiered/{manifest,research,summary}.json`
  (heuristic classifier from the `selection` branch; absolute paths stale).

## Agent task

1. The physical reorganization is already done by the owner — verify
   against the layout in `07_...md` rather than moving files. Record it in
   a corpus manifest (`maps/blood/corpus.json` + short README, replacing
   the stale flat-corpus `campaign/README.md`) including the named view
   `reference = campaign + curated`, the mode axis (`mode=sp|multiplayer`
   from the `multiplayer/` subdirectories, cross-checked against player
   starts), and the owner-provenance notes.
2. Introduce a corpus registry that resolves populations from the directory
   layout (directory provenance authoritative, filename prefixes only a
   sanity cross-check); fix `classify_map_population` and the population
   table in `docs/design-pattern-discovery.md` accordingly; keep the
   `BLOODMAP_CORPUS` override.
3. Make corpus enumeration recursive and population-aware; `community` and
   `tiered` must resolve to one population with tier as metadata, never two.
4. Run the parse gate over the community corpus fail-closed: emit a
   machine-readable report (per map: parses / roundtrips / version /
   failure reason) under `reports/`; do not normalize failures.
5. Update `docs/corpus.md` and `docs/design-pattern-discovery.md` command
   examples to the new layout.
6. Tests: population resolution for each directory, tier metadata attach,
   the `reference` view membership, fail-closed behavior on an unsupported
   fixture.

## Exit criteria

`python -m bloodmap corpus`-level commands enumerate the new layout;
`pattern-mine --population blood-campaign` finds exactly the original
`E*M*.MAP` set and nothing hand-picked or converted; `blood-bloodbath`
resolves to `campaign/multiplayer/` (BB1–BB9 only); DWE/TEDE resolve to
`community-curated` and DNE to `own-conversion`; a community-corpus health
report exists and states how many maps pass the gate.

---

# Phase 0 — Stabilize current foundations

## Already in the repository

Ownership boundaries exist and are documented in module docstrings and
`docs/architecture.md`:

- `Assembly` = mechanism membership + relations (`bloodmap/assembly.py`),
- `doors.py` = specialized dynamic interpretation,
- `spatial.py` = independent derived spatial views,
- `knowledge/blood/design/` = evidence-backed retrieval surface with an
  explicit promotion rule (README),
- generated maps never become evidence (`docs/design-pattern-discovery.md`).

## Gap

No single note states these boundaries for a newcomer agent; a few behaviors
lack pinning tests.

## Agent task

Write a short architecture note (or extend `docs/architecture.md`) mapping
"where does a new fact of kind X belong"; add pinning tests only where a
boundary is load-bearing and untested. No new abstractions.

## Exit criteria

An agent can explain where a new mechanism fact belongs without inventing a
parallel framework.

---

# Phase 1 — General relation extraction (DONE, 2026-08-31)

**Status: complete.** `bloodmap/relations.py` extracts ten object-scale
relation kinds over a `BuildIR` neighborhood (`extract_relations`,
`neighborhood`, `sprite_dense_seeds`, `mine_relations`); CLI `relation-dump`
and `relation-mine`; report `reports/blood-object-relations-pilot.{json,md}`;
tests `tests/test_relations.py`.

Frame independence is pinned, not asserted: the same neighborhood of a
translated or quarter-turn-rotated map yields an identical document, checked on
a synthetic map and on three campaign maps. The first run of that check failed
(`repeats_along` ordered its members by position, so a half turn reversed the
row) and the fix is in.

Measured on 5 campaign maps' sprite-densest neighborhoods, 2432 relations:
268/310 `rests_on` sit exactly on the floor plane, 261/297 `faces_wall` are
exactly square to the wall's inward normal, and `against_wall` distance is
bimodal -- but that second mode is one map's repeated furnishing, not a
convention. Evenly spaced identical sprite rows are **rare** (1 run in the
sample), which is a negative result about Blood: the detector does find them
where they exist, recovering E6M1's three-mannequin display row from geometry
alone.

## Already in the repository

- `design.py` / `spatial.py`: adjacency, portals, polygon loops, derived
  spatial views;
- `structures.py`: object-scale candidates with evidence and residuals;
- `prefab.py`: small-sector kinds; `reachability.py`: playable vs support
  geometry; `assembly.py`: relational facts inside mechanisms.

## Gap

No unified, inspectable **object-scale relation dump** using the vocabulary
of `03_...md` (against_wall, faces, aligned_with, repeats_along, supports,
…), with provenance, usable as input for anchor and unsigned mining.

## Agent task

Build a relation extractor over `BuildIR` for a *local neighborhood*
(sector cluster + sprites + walls), reusing existing sensors, emitting
normalized JSON with provenance per relation. Pilot on 3–5 campaign maps.
Do not add relations no consumer needs yet.

## Exit criteria

The system can describe a local object-scale neighborhood without semantic
names, and the dump is stable under translation/rotation of the input.

---

# Phase 2 — Semantic-anchor mining (DONE, 2026-08-31)

**Status: complete.** `bloodmap/anchors.py` is the general form of the two
hand-written miners (`AnchorSpec`, `anchor_from_tiles` / `anchor_from_material`
/ `anchor_from_regions`, `find_occurrences`, `context_signature`, `mine_anchor`,
`mine_kit`, `load_kit`); CLI `anchor-mine` (with `--kit`, which reads a
`role_assets` table -- including from a reference report's own); reports
`reports/anchor-queries.md` plus `anchor-{e6m1-shop,sewer-kit}.json`; tests
`tests/test_anchors.py`.

Both reference reports reproduce through the general path: e6m1-shop's 11
`asset_counts` exactly, sewer-kit's 5 densest maps exactly (map, uses, and
`affected_sectors`). `maps_with_use` differs by one for two sewer roles, and
the new number is the right one -- the extra map in the old path is
`campaign/ASAVE1.map`, the autosave Phase 0a quarantines. First statistic the
quarantine has changed.

Beyond tile lookup: each anchor gets a clustered context signature, its
counterexamples, its anchor-free analogues, and an **enrichment** figure -- how
much more often the anchor's sectors carry the dominant context than sectors
with none of its tiles. Object anchors are strongly enriched (mannequin 30.4x,
chair 11.6x, outlet 9.4x); bulk surface anchors are not (pipe walls 1.15x,
sewer door 0.53x), which is the tool reporting that its own dominant cluster is
meaningless for a material. That split is the phase's main finding.

## Already in the repository

`tools/mine_e6m1_shop.py` and `tools/mine_sewer_kit.py` are working
single-anchor miners (owner-identified assets, carrying sectors, one-hop
neighborhoods, no cross-map tile inference). CLI has `sprite-context-mine`,
`door-mine`, `materials-mine`. A ready-made anchor input exists:
`knowledge/blood/design/owner-anchors-v1.json` — ~37 owner hand-tagged
picnums (shelves, crates, drawer/bookcase fronts, grates, pipes, machinery,
clocks, …) including intact/broken state pairs and known dual roles.

## Gap

Each anchor is a hand-written script. There is no reusable anchor query that
takes labels (tiles / materials / example regions) and runs the Phase 1
neighborhood extraction across a chosen population.

## Agent task

Generalize the two mining scripts into one anchor-query tool
(`python -m bloodmap anchor-mine …` or `tools/`): input = anchor spec,
population; output = occurrences, multi-scale neighborhoods, clustered
recurring relations, anchor-free analogue search, counterexamples. Validate
by reproducing the e6m1-shop and sewer-kit reports through the new path.

## Exit criteria

One anchor produces useful knowledge beyond tile lookup, and the two
existing reference reports are reproducible outputs, not one-offs.

---

# Phase 3 — Unsigned structural candidate discovery (DONE, 2026-08-31)

**Status: complete.** One family added to the existing pipeline, not a new
framework: `patterns.observe_object_context` + `_object_context_signature`,
registered in `_SIGNATURES` and wired into `observe_map`, with features from
Phase 1 relations. `pattern-mine` gained `--tier` and `--limit`. Report:
`reports/blood-object-context-families.md`. Tests: `tests/test_patterns.py`.

Scale bands are corpus quartiles, not round numbers -- the first guess put
nearly every campaign sector in one height bucket and made the facet
decorative.

Measured: 1328 campaign candidates over 6599 occurrences, **80% of them in
candidates recurring across three or more maps** (`route-exposure`, already in
the pipeline, manages 50%). 89% of BloodBath and 84% of tier-S object-context
occurrences use a signature the campaign also uses. The clearest unprogrammed
find is a contrast pair: a tiny, tight, two-portal sector holding exactly one
wall-bound object, `seated:none` (77 occ / 28 maps) versus `seated:all` (72 occ
/ 24 maps) -- a wall fixture in a passage niche against the same niche with the
fixture on the floor.

The Phase 2 prediction (object anchors cluster tightly, material anchors do
not) was tested and is **directionally supported but not established**:
r = 0.541 at n = 13, with `outlet` and `sewer_door` as clear counterexamples,
and the two measures taken on different corpora.

## Already in the repository

`patterns.py` mines unsigned candidates over discrete signatures (spawn
neighborhoods, route exposure, morphology, vertical transitions) with strict
population separation; `structures.py` yields unsigned geometry candidates.

## Gap

No object-scale unsigned families: tiny-sector clusters, repeated shallow
wall structures, sprite+wall furniture-like assemblies. No cross-map
coverage stats over the enlarged corpus.

## Agent task

Add one or two object-scale signature families to the existing pattern
pipeline (not a new framework), using Phase 1 relations as features. Run on
campaign (SP + multiplayer), then sample `tiered/S`. Report candidate stability
and cross-map coverage.

## Exit criteria

At least several visually/semantically meaningful clusters found that were
not explicitly programmed as named concepts.

---

# Phase 4 — Contrastive concepts and counterexamples

## Already in the repository

Anchors for both sides of several contrasts exist (`furniture.py` named
props, `item_display.py`, crate/shelf tiles in the e6m1-shop reference).

## Gap

No contrast reports; discriminating relations are not measured.

## Agent task

Pick two pilots (shelf vs crate pile; storefront vs generic window). For
each: positive set, comparison set, measured discriminating relations,
ambiguous cases, rejected hypotheses. Statistics must be actually measured,
in the `10_...md` reporting style.

## Exit criteria

A hypothesis explains both positive and negative evidence relationally, not
by texture or bounding box alone.

---

# Phase 5 — Object assemblies and negative space

## Already in the repository

`player_space.py` (openings, clearance, enclosure vs player profiles),
`placement.py`, `furniture.py` mounting semantics, `assembly.py` grouping
discipline for mechanisms.

## Gap

Assembly grouping for *static* furniture bundles; explicit negative-space
representation (access fronts, pull-out volumes); random-scatter detector.

## Agent task

Implement grouping rules for one bundle type (counter + workspace, or table
+ chairs) mined from campaign maps; add a minimal clearance representation
and check; build the scatter detector and validate it on synthetic
authored-vs-scattered scenes (validation only, never evidence).

## Exit criteria

The system distinguishes an authored assembly from the same props randomly
distributed nearby.

---

# Phase 6 — Functional regions

## Already in the repository

`reachability.py` already assigns *roles* to non-playable geometry
(logic_closet, letterforms) — the precedent for role assignment from
relations. The e6m1-shop reference records counter / retail floor / display
clusters for one real shop.

## Gap

In-room functional zoning (shop floor, counter boundary, storage, office
corner) as mined candidates.

## Agent task

Using Phase 5 bundles + circulation from `spatial.py`, mine functional
region candidates in the maps where anchors already exist (E6M1 shop first),
then search analogues corpus-wide. Hierarchical containment in the output.

## Exit criteria

The system can explain that one room contains multiple functional zones,
with evidence.

---

# Phase 7 — Facade grammar

## Already in the repository

`aperture.py` (an opening is a leaf plus mediation; reveal dressing rules),
`texture_align.py`, `lettering.py`, run-rhythm and wall-thickness knowledge
files, rendered street views under `projects/blood-city/references/
e6m1-shop-views/`.

## Gap

Facade/bay hierarchy as a mined object: main plane, bays, datums (sill /
header / cornice), rhythm, style inheritance.

## Agent task

Facade candidate extractor over street-facing campaign maps (E6M1 and the
city episodes are natural pilots): identify facade extent, plane, openings,
thin helper sectors, measure repeated datums; render street views for
validation; search cross-map analogues; keep counterexamples.

## Exit criteria

The system can explain why several openings belong to one facade and what
keeps it coherent. Only then may `facade_run()`-style constructors be
promoted into `vocabulary.py`.

---

# Phase 8 — Neutral dynamic-state observations

## Already in the repository

Most of this phase: `assembly.py` (travel, pivot, carried parts),
`doors.py` (rest/open geometry, interaction, condition, feedback,
signifier), `mechanism.py` (template-driven construction), `motion_sim.py`
(engine-exact motion), `state_model.py`, `mechanisms.py` (cross-game
semantic layer).

## Gap

A single minimal physical-effect vocabulary (`move_z_floor`, `translate_xy`,
`change_blocking`, `destroy`, …) shared by these modules, and the
three-way experiment from `05_...md` (door vs lift vs third Z-motion
mechanism described without naming them incorrectly).

## Agent task

Extract the neutral effect vocabulary from what `assembly.py`/`doors.py`
already record — as a *reading*, not a rewrite. Run the door/lift/other
experiment on campaign maps and report LOW LEVEL / SPATIAL EFFECT /
SEMANTICS per `05_...md`.

## Exit criteria

The same low-level motion representation describes all three mechanisms;
semantic distinction comes from spatial context, and the report shows it.

---

# Phase 9 — Conditional topology and causal meaning

## Already in the repository

`reachability.py` (at-rest reachability), `progression.py`,
`sp_understand.py` (physical walkability kept separate from allowed
progress), channel graphs in `fragment.py`/`assembly.py`.

## Gap

A derived `conditional_traversability` view: edges annotated with the
mechanism state that enables them, and the trigger → mechanism →
reachability chain.

## Agent task

Add the conditional view to `spatial.py`-style derived views, fed by Phase 8
effects. Pilots: one lift, one breakable barrier, one keyed door, on
campaign maps. Answer "what becomes reachable after this action" with
causal provenance.

## Exit criteria

The question above is answered mechanically and the explanation cites
native evidence (channels, XSECTOR fields), not prose.

---

# Phase 10 — Multi-view understanding bundle

## Already in the repository

`understanding.py` and `sp_understand.py` already bundle sensors;
`level_profile.py` gives the corpus-comparison view; `visual.py` the
rendered view.

## Gap

One map, all views, cross-view contradictions made explicit.

## Agent task

For one selected original map, produce one machine-readable bundle + one
human-readable report combining geometry, assemblies, functional regions,
mechanisms, conditional topology, progression, visual/readability — with a
section listing disagreements between views.

## Exit criteria

No single view pretends to be canonical; cross-view relations are explicit.

---

# Phase 11 — Automatic discovery frontier + batched review

## Gap (new work)

Ranked candidate queue with novelty/coverage/uncertainty, and batched
review actions (confirm / reject / split / show counterexamples) that
propagate. Review is a queue, never a blocking gate (project norm).

## Exit criteria

The user no longer needs to manually enumerate most concepts to
investigate.

---

# Phase 12 — Recursive knowledge growth

Use learned concepts as new atoms (drawer unit → desk assembly → office
region; storefront → facade → street frontage). Provenance must survive
through abstraction layers.

## Exit criteria

The system discovers patterns not expressible in raw sector/wall/sprite
terms.

---

# Phase 13 — Design intent + synthesis

Generate from semantic/function/architecture intent, not coordinate soup.
This must land in the existing source representation: level programs and
`vocabulary.py` constructors, per the project's representation-first
priority. Deliverables: design-intent IR, deterministic compilation,
hard/soft/style constraints.

## Exit criteria

A prompt such as "small street-facing shop, two-bay facade, recessed
storefront, counter, rear storage" produces a structure whose relationships
survive changes of width, orientation, or art set.

---

# Phase 14 — Independent critics and scoped repair

## Already in the repository

Independent critics exist (geometry validate/audit, level_profile, NBlood
oracle, visual observer, overlap validator) and feed `authoring_loop.py`.

## Gap

Structured diagnoses with repair scope; semantic-delta validation after
repair. Standing warning: critic rules have historically measured the wrong
thing — every critic must name its oracle and a failure it provably
detects.

## Exit criteria

A facade readability failure can be repaired without changing progression
or rebuilding unrelated rooms, and the semantic delta proves it.

---

# Phase 15 — Quality diversity

Late-stage. Once understanding and critics are reliable, maintain diverse
valid solutions along axes (verticality, loopiness, openness, clutter,
facade rhythm, encounter density, mechanism complexity). Do not use
quality-diversity to hide weak semantic understanding.
